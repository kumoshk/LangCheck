# LangCheck
This Python script takes a URL and returns a list of words that the text at the URL contains (and the number of times if occurs) which if you search the text for those words might  reveal cause for such as parental guidance. Primarily, it checks for foul language, expletives, euphemisms, insults, name-calling, hate speech, and sensitive words, but it also does some checking for drugs/alcohol and a little for sex-related content. Some words returned are irrelevant (or match the queries but are not offensive), but this is to catch larger swaths of target words. Warning: The source code contains words which will probably be offensive if you choose to read it. If you're confused about why a word is listed, feel free to ask for clarification (do not jump to conclusions); some words can be neutral or positive in one context and derogatory in another. This software is not comprehensive and does not catch all of the stated content (but it should catch the vast majority of foul language); it is a work in progress, and is not considered complete (although I personally consider it to be useful for my purposes). It takes a while to check something as long as a novel, as I haven't optimized the code for speed. This is a command-line Python script. It depends on the requests module available via pip.
